# Knights
_Search algorithm visualization_

This started with a CodeWars kata called [Knight's Attack!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58e6d83e19af2cb8840000b5), which is essentially a maze problem, with the additional constraint that you have to move like a night on a chessboard.

I finally solved this after reading and working through [Classic CS Problems in Python](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python). I added some visualization with a tkinter library so I could see what areas of the board had been searched, which were in the stack/queue/heap, and what the final path was.

Excellent reference for whenever I need to remember how depth-first, breadth-first, and A* search algorithms work.
